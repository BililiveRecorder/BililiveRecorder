## Apology

GitHub is a global platform, and theoretically, everyone should use English. But since this project is only meant for Chinese user and rely on a Chinese website [BiliBili](https://live.bilibili.com) (_[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilibili)_), all code comments are in Chinese. This README file will always use English so people like _you_ can understand what is this, and perhaps make some use out of it.

## Install & Use

See [rec.danmuji.org](https://rec.danmuji.org) (in Chinese)
